Hello! I am a first year btech student studying in IIT Guwahati.
I have a keen interest in competitive coding, machine learning, and game development.
In addition to this, I have developed a newfound obsession with mixed martial arts (particularly UFC), watching it as well as learning from it.
Along with these, I enjoy watching and playing football, tennis, and volleyball.  

I want to join open source as I strive to learn and improvise by observing and implementing new, more efficient ways of solving a particular problem.
Moreover, I would like to share my thinking and knowledge with the community as much as I can.
